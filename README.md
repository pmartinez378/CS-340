How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I prioritize modularity, clear variable names, and detailed comments to guide future modifications. In the CRUD Python module from Project One, I separated each CRUD function (Create, Read, Update, Delete) into distinct methods, making it easy to connect these functionalities to dashboard widgets in Project Two. This modular approach enabled me to reuse and adapt code without rewriting it, saving time and reducing errors. In future projects, I could use this CRUD module as a foundation for similar applications requiring database interactions, especially in scenarios where dynamic data management is necessary.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems by breaking down requirements into smaller tasks, prioritizing functionality, and then building each part systematically. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I first analyzed the database and dashboard requirements separately, creating a structured plan to connect them logically. This project required integrating multiple components and user interactions cohesively. In the future, I would use this strategy, along with relational database design techniques, to ensure efficient data flow and responsiveness. 

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve complex problems by developing algorithms and systems that simplify processes, automate tasks, and enable data-driven decisions. This work is essential because it helps organizations streamline operations, improve accuracy, and achieve scalability. For Grazioso Salvare, my work on this project would provide them with a reliable, user-friendly interface for managing and analyzing their data, leading to more efficient workflows and faster, more informed decision-making. By designing a tailored dashboard and database connection, I can help them reduce time spent on data management, allowing them to focus more on their core mission and strategic goals.
